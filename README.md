#### 星光互联(starrydns) Reviews

**Performance and Reliability:** StarryDNS VPS demonstrates **exceptional stability** with reported uptime rates reaching **99.9%** across Hong Kong and Japan nodes. Users particularly praise the **strong IO performance**, making it ideal for database-intensive applications and content management systems.

**Network Performance:** Testing reveals that **Japan Osaka nodes** deliver latency between **50-100ms** for mainland China users, while Hong Kong nodes show more variation in domestic access speeds. However, **overseas connectivity remains consistently fast**, making it excellent for international business operations.

**Value Assessment:** The service offers **outstanding cost-performance ratio**, especially during promotional periods with the **$5/month Japan special package**. The KVM virtualization ensures dedicated resources without overselling issues common with other providers.

**Considerations:** While the service excels in overseas performance, users seeking **optimized China mainland routing** may find the three-network (China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile) optimization lacking. This makes it less suitable for users requiring ultra-low latency to mainland China.

**Customer Support:** The provider offers responsive support through ticket system and maintains comprehensive documentation in both Chinese and English, facilitating smooth onboarding for international users.
